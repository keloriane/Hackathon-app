# Hackathon-app

## Introduction

The idea is to have an app to simplify whan there is a new hackathon to have a better communication between Kevin and Sarah.

## Needs

The best thing to have is a Web App to manage every new hackathons.
On a new form, we should be able to register a new hackathon and post it on ryver.
For each new hackathon's , we should have the possibility to enter:

- The name of the hackathon,
- When is it ?
- How much is it ?
- Link of the event,
- How many people can attend (Max attendences...).
- Link to get the tickets.

Then post a google form to sign up for the hackathon. the result of each form should be place in a googlesheet file that Sarah and Kevin can see and work on it.
Each member of the Becode team will have the autorization to upload a new Hackathon.
mail adress with `name@becode.org`.

## The hard parts

The hard parts is to work with the google APi to synchronize everything....
WIP...

## Motivation

It help becode to have a clear structure to manage hackathon. And to avoid any bad communication.
